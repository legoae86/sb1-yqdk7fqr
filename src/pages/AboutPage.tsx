            <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
              MONOCHROME was founded in 2020 with a simple mission: to create timeless, minimalist clothing that transcends trends and seasons. We believe in the power of simplicity and the elegance of essential pieces that form the foundation of a versatile wardrobe.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
              Our journey began when our founder, a former fashion industry veteran, became disillusioned with the fast fashion cycle and its impact on both creativity and the environment. The vision was clear: create a brand that celebrates quality over quantity, timelessness over trends, and conscious consumption over excess.
